= JMH Maven Plugin

This is a maven plugin able to run https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/[JMH] benchmarks
contained in the test sources without much other ceremony.

== Prior Art

=== JMH archetype
The archetype for JMH sets up a structure where it uses its generator to generate the benchmark scaffolding
and then it sets up the maven build with a shade plugin that combines all the dependencies, benchmark
classes, and the scaffolding classes into a single jar.

One is then expected to run this jar with JMH specific arguments to run the actual benchmark.

Another caveat of this approach is that this is best done in a separate maven module and thus you have the benchmarks
separate from your actual code and tests.

=== JMH Maven Plugin from Baidu

There already is a maven plugin that does the same thing as this project, the `com.baidu.maven:jmh-maven-plugin`.
The Baidu maven plugin only runs the benchmark that already needs to be built though, possibly using the archetype
approach mentioned above.

== Usage

This plugin tries to be more ergonomic. It searches for the benchmarks in the test sources, can work directly in the
same module as the code being benchmarked, doesn't require shading, and can actually both build and run the benchmarks.

As such, one usually only needs to do this:

In `pom.xml`:
```xml

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjdk.jmh</groupId> <1>
        <artifactId>jmh-core</artifactId>
        <version>...</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>pw.krejci</groupId> <2>
            <artifactId>jmh-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>...</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

<1> You write your benchmarks in the test sources, so you need to depend on JMH core in your tests. You can use any
version of JMH you will, the plugin will under the hood use the JMH annotation processor of the same version for
compiling the benchmarks.

<2> Declaring this plugin in the `pom.xml` makes it possible to later invoke it using its short name.

With this simple setup, you are then able to run the benchmarks using just:

```
mvn jmh:benchmark
```

NOTE: It is not possible to run the benchmarks as part of a normal build. This plugin needs to be invoked explicitly
from the commandline. This is because benchmarks are usually long-running and running them is not usually needed as part
of a normal build process.

== Selecting Benchmarks to Run

Using the property `jmh.benchmarks` which is a comma separated list of regexes, you can specify which benchmarks should be run.

E.g.

```
mvn jmh:benchmark -Djmh.benchmarks=Quick
```

== Passing Parameters

This plugin is designed for direct invocation. But you can also configure the default values of the parameters in its
plugin configuration in the `pom.xml`.

For the latter you can use the property names from the table below. As such, the `pom.xml` contains the long, human
readable names of the properties.

On the commandline, this plugin uses the parameter names derived from the corresponding commandline parameters
of JMH itself.

So a JMH benchmark.jar based invocation like:

```
java -jar target/benchmark.jar -i 15 -bm thrpt
```

can be invoked using this plugin as:

```
mvn jmh:benchmark -Djmh.i=15 -Djmh.bm=thrpt
```

You can get the help text for the various parameters using this invocation:

```
mvn jmh:benchmark -Djmh.h
```

The following parameters are supported:

|===
| Property | Commandline name | JMH equivalent

| `benchmarkMode` | `jmh.bm` | `-bm`
| `batchSize` | `jmh.bs` | `-bs`
| `exclude` | `jmh.e` | `-e`

| `listProfilers` | `jmh.lprof` | `-lprof`
| `outputFile` | `jmh.o` | `-o`

| `threadGroups` | `jmh.tg` | `-tg`
| `timeout` | `jmh.to` | `-to`
| `timeUnit` | `jmh.tu` | `-tu`
| `verbosity` | `jmh.v` | `-v`
| `warmup` | `jmh.w` | `-w`
| `warmupBatchSize` | `jmh.wbs` | `-wbs`
| `warmupForks` | `jmh.wf` | `-wf`
| `warmupIterations` | `jmh.wi` | `-wi`
| `warmupMode` | `jmh.wm` | `-wm`
| `warmupBenchmarks` | `jmh.wmb` | `-wmb`

== Notes

This plugin does not generate the uber-jar as is usual with the default JMH approach. It instead just invokes
the benchmark with the classpath containing all dependencies from the pom.
